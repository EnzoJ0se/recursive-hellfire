# RECURSIVE HELLFIRE

A 2d third person shooter with gameplay focus, the idea is a rogue lite with a "bullet hell" style.
The focus is build up a class til the boss of the level. Maybe add dungens on levels and think in a
procedural end game.

OBS: this is a side projetc to learn more about lua and love2d.
OBS 2: Thats just for fun.
